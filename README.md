# Password Generator App

For this assignment we were tasked with using javascript to create a random password generator utilizing user input criteria including number of characters and whether to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. 

This assignment was pull-my-hair-out and scream at my kids to go bug someone else in spite of there not being anyone else to bug difficult, and yet it was infuriatingly brilliant. It really made me figure out how to break things down into little bitty pieces to figure out how to make it work, and stretch my brain to fill in some big gaps in understanding. All of the moving parts have been fascinating and frustrating.

Why isn't this working and what the hell does that cryptic error even mean? 

Long about the time something finally clicked for the first step and I realized I was declaring my variables locally rather than just calling them in to the function I was hooked and had to figure it out on top of just being able to complete the assignment. 

As I submit this, my array is not pushing properly, and I can't find the missing bit, but with the holiday coming I am going to persevere and figure it out. 

Tiniest little baby step... ready to push myself toward Olympic track and field.
